# About #

```bubble_sort.asm``` is a bubble sort algorithm written in MIPS assembly. You can change the given array by editing the source code directly. ```guess_my_number_human_player.asm``` is a game where the computer chooses a number and the player tries to guess it.

## Running the programs ##

In order to run the programs you will need a way to run .asm files. I used MARS from Softpedia (http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/download.htm). Open this program and open the file of your choice. To run, do the following:

1. Choose run>assemble in the upper menu
2. Click the play button
3. View output in bottom partition
